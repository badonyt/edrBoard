# edrboard
This is a copy of [nohboard](https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard). But available on linux.

## Missing
* What is missing is support to put the buttons whenever you want on the screen.
* Fixing issues(if there is)
* Keys not working when app is focused(not in my control)
* Putting another json file in, in the same session. Breaks it.
